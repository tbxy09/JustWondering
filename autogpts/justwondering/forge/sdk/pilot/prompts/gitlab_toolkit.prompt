The **GitLab agent toolkit** is a set of tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a GitLab repository¹. It is a wrapper for the `python-gitlab` library and provides various functionalities for working with GitLab repositories¹. Some of the actions that can be performed using the GitLab agent toolkit include fetching issues from the repository, fetching details about a specific issue, posting a comment on a specific issue, creating a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch, creating a new file in the repository, reading a file from the repository, updating a file in the repository, and deleting a file from the repository¹. 

To get started with the GitLab agent toolkit, you will need to install the `python-gitlab` library, create a GitLab personal access token, and set some environmental variables¹. The toolkit provides a simple API for performing these actions and can be used to interact with a GitLab repository in your agent¹.

Please note that the GitLab agent toolkit is specifically designed for working with GitLab repositories and may not be compatible with other version control systems like GitHub¹.
