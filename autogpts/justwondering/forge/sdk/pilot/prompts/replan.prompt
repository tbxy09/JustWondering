You previously generated steps to build a web app:

{% for step, status in step_statuses.items() %}
Step {{loop.index}}: {{step}} - {{status}} 
{% endfor %}

Based on the above outcomes, regenerate the optimal sequence of remaining steps to complete the project.

{% if step_statuses['step_1'] == 'failed' %}
Since step 1 failed, generate a step to handle this failure before continuing.
{% endif %}

{% if step_statuses['step_2'] == 'failed' %}
Since step 2 failed, generate a step to handle this failure before proceeding.
{% endif %}

{% if step_statuses['step_3'] == 'success' %}
Since step 3 succeeded, generate the next step assuming it was completed.
{% endif %}

Make sure the regenerated list of steps is adjusted based on the previous outcomes provided.
